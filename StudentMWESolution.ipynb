    "The first part is to determine the second moment of area - the question does not specify *which* $I$ to determine but from the nature of the question it should be clear that the answer is for the $I_{xx}$. This can be determine for the three different sized members. Members 12 and 34 are trapezoids which will have equal contributions. After finding the expression for the second moment of area of a trapezoid (recall, we found this in class - I then showed that it was easily googlable), this is given by the parallel axis theorem\n",
